## Interview Questions

Be prepared to demonstrate your understanding of this week's concepts by answering questions on the following topics. You might prepare by writing down your own answers before hand.

1. Briefly compare and contrast `.forEach` & `.map` (2-3 sentences max)

    the difference between forEach and .map is that:
        .map returns a new array, if you want to obtain a modified version of the array, use .map

        forEach does not return anything. if you want to modify but not to make a new array, use forEach

2. Explain the difference between a callback and a higher order function.

        Higher Oder Function: takes another function as argument and or returns a function to its callers.

        Callback Function: is passed to another function with expectation that the other function will call it

3. What is closure?

        closures are created everytime a functoin is created. a closure is simply:

                a combination of a enclosed of a function bundled together with references to its surrounding state or the lexical environment

                gives you access to an outer function's scope from an inner function.

4. Describe the four rules of the 'this' keyword.

        1. Implicit Binding: left of the Dot at Call time. (this.name) in other words be (me.name)
    
        2. Explicit Binding: call, apply
        The function is one the global scope, would need to use .call or.apply to invoke the global function. 
        
        each one is used differently
        
        3. new Binding: "this is refered to a or the specific instance of that particular object that is created and returnd by the function that is the constructor"
    
        4. window Binding: "this" uses the global scope


5. Why do we need super() in an extended class?

        super() / super is used to call and access functions on an object's parent.

        calls the parent constructor
